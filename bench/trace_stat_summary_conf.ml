(** Summary configuration.

    This file is NOT meant to be used from Tezos, as opposed to some other
    "trace_*" files. *)

let histo_bin_count = 16

let curves_sample_count = 201

(** Parameter to control the width of the moving average window.

    This width is expressed as a fraction of the width of the final plot images,
    (i.e. the number of played blocks). This implies that the amount of
    smoothing remains visually the same, no matter [curves_sample_count] and the
    number of blocks in the stat trace.

    Justification of the current value:

    The 2nd commit of the full replay trace is a massive one, it contains ~1000x
    more operations than an average one, it takes ~10 half lives to fully get
    rid of it from the EMAs. With [moving_average_half_life_ratio = 1. /. 80.],
    that 2nd commit will only poluate [1 / 8] of the width of the smoothed
    curves. *)
let moving_average_half_life_ratio = 1. /. 80.
